5. Critical settings (random salt and special symbol candidates) can be saved to **FPG_CriticalSettings.dat** for backup, or can be shown as QR code for easy migration. For Android and iOS versions, critical settings can also be saved to and read from NFC tags

### Backup File
The backup file **FPG_CriticalSettings.dat** generated by other versions of FPG can be transferred to the device and restored in app as follows:

* **Android**: Connect device to a computer (using File Transfer mode), then copy generated **FPG_CriticalSettings.dat** file into **/Android/data/org.xlfdll.nb.fpg/files**
  * macOS users can use the official [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) app to do so
* **iOS**: Use iTunes App File Sharing to transfer **FPG_CriticalSettings.dat** file
* **macOS**: Currently the app uses App Sandbox. The backup file can be accessed from **~/Library/Containers/org.xlfdll.nb.fpg/Data/Documents**
